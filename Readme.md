DSLite : An Open Generic Implementation of all the popular datastructures
=================================================================================

With the ever present demand for the use of DataStructures such as Heaps and Trees in Application development paradigm, the process of manually writing DataStructures gets redundant and inefficient. DSLite aims to provide light weight generic Datastructures implemented in cpp for inclusion in application development for platforms such as Embedded Systems (ESP32, ARM etc).
